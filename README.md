# Smart-room-occupancy-energy-saver-
An Arduino-based smart sysytem that detects room occupancy using sensors and automatically turns OFF lights,fans and devices to save electricity.Built for rural and urban applications to reduce energy waste.Includes AI-generated diagrams and real hardware-tested logic .

##. Project purpose.

• To reduce the wastage of electricity in
  local rural farms.
• To make farming budget friendly for poor
  farmers.
• To provide a low cost,efficient and
  sacalble solutions for smart energy
  usage specially in ruaral areas where
  energy resource is precious and awareness
  is still growing.

##. Features.

 • Automatic power control: 
   Turns appliances ON/OFF based on room 
   occupancy.
 • Motion sensor and camera detection:
   Uses PIR sensor and optional camera to 
   detect presence.
 • Relay-based switching:
   Control AC or DC devices via Arduino and     relay module.
 • Energy Efficient:
   Reduces power wastage in empty rooms.
 • Real world tested:
   verified performance in actual room          conditions.
 • Expandable design:
   can add light,temperature sensors and app
   contol in future.
